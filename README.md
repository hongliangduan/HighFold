# HighFold: accurately predicting structures of cyclic peptides and complexes with head-to-tail and disulfide bridge constraints

HighFold is a novol framework for cyclic peptide structure prediction. Based on head-to-tail and disulfide bridge constraints, a Cyclic Position Offset Encoding Matrix (CycPOEM) is constructed and feed into the AlphaFold model. 

## Advantanges of HighFold

- Cyclic peptide structure prediction for both monomers and complexes.
- Multiple cyclizations such as head-to-tail and disulfide bridges.
- High effectiveness and efficiency.

## Instructions

### Installation

You can install the ColabFold by the script LocalColabFold (details on https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold) at first, and then copy the source codes of HighFold into the installed ColabFold preject.

### Data Preparation

The amino acid sequence should be processed in fasta format.

```
